If you are building for a Posix system, just do this:

	$ cd src
	$ make
	# make install

If you are building for some other system, you can try to
use the following instructions, but you may have trouble.

The project uses GNU autoconf and GNU automake to generate
scripts which will configure the build system. If there is
not a 'configure' script present, run these commands to
generate one based on the settings in configure.ac:

	$ autoconf
	$ automake

You can use the configure script to configure the build.
Run `./configure --help` for a complete list of options.
Then run `make` to build the software and `make install`
to install it. Here's a summary of the commands:

	$ ./configure
	$ make
	# make install
